AI Health Assistant – For Those "Not-So-Great" Mornings
This AI Agent is designed to support you when you wake up feeling a bit off—like a slight sore throat or general discomfort.

Think of it as a real-time conversational health companion. You can describe your symptoms, ask questions, and have a brief chat. The agent will then offer helpful insights about what might be going on, along with suggestions on what's good or best to avoid.

⚠️ Note: This is not a replacement for professional medical advice or treatment.

Instead, it’s here to provide calm, informative guidance to help reduce that initial wave of anxiety before you consult a doctor.
